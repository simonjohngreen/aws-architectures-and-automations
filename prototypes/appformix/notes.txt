deplyer is here deployers/Contrail-One-Click-Deployer-Prototype1.json 

its adds an ec2 and tells contrail comand to deploy appformix into it. 

Ansible completes but infact the appformix instance gets docker and then nothing else. 

I sorted out the mount so seems to me to be broken in contrail command. I see a few emails with other folks saying the same. 

Perhaps try again in the next release.
